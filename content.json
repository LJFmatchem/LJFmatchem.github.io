Besides, the interaction between ions and solvents is a very complex process, and even in the absence of ions, the structure of pure solvents is complicated. The adverse effects of the first two points can be infinitely reduced by diluting the solution, and the third point can be avoided by asking appropriate questions. But what is the exact degree of fully diluted electrolyte? There is a crucial hint relating to activity coefficient and ionic strength. In dilute electrolytes, these two parameters follow. We can see that the mean activity factor of ions is only to do with the charge of ions and concentration . In that case, we neglect excessive properties of ions, such as electron configuration. We can construct an ideal system with the following rules: Electrolyte completely ionized Ions are charged spheres without polarization There is only Coulomb interaction between ions The ion interaction energy is significantly less than the thermal kinetic energy Ignore the change of dielectric constant caused by adding electrolyte For non-associated electrolytes, all these conditions can be infinitely approached by diluting the electrolyte. Further, why should thermal kinetics be introduced? Thermal motion is an essential part of the problem of electrolyte solution because, without it, ions and molecules will rest in the configuration with the lowest energy. Specifically, thermal kinetics implies that the theory to be developed must be statistical. If the distribution of ions is known, it is possible to calculate the electric potential arising from this distribution. But the calculation of the distribution requires the use of the electrical potential. Debye and Hückle founded the modern theory in 1923. Numerous workers have refined their treatment, including Bjerrum, Onsager, and Falkenhagen. For a volume unit in the solution, considering the distribution of the ions: the result must be trivial because there is no reason for one point in space to be different from another, and the ions' distribution is uniform in terms of the macro. How to make one point different from another? How to define a valuable ion distribution? One point is different from the other only because of the electrostatic effects. A quick answer: stand on an ion and look out Ionic atmosphere model Following the viewpoint of \"stand on an ion and look out.\" In the volume element around the central ion, the probability of the same charge ion decreases, and the probability of the event of the heterologous charge ion increases. The spherical symmetry of the ion electric field leads to the spherical symmetry of the charge distribution around the ion. Thus, that provides a practical problem: Find the charge density distribution at the distance from the center Debye and Hückle assumed the Boltzmann distribution law, according to which, since the electric potential energy of an -ion is . the average local concentration of -ions at the point in the equation is Once more, the subscript attached to reminds us that, like , is only meaningful in the (moving) coordinate system based on the central -ion. Before discussing alternative distribution laws, we shall proceed to evaluate , the better to see what effect the alternatives may have. Since each -ion carriers a charge , the net charge density at the point considered is, summing for ionic species, Now, what determines the electric potential? Poisson's equation is the most general expression of Coulomb's law of force between charged bodies and is written as: Under the spherical symmetric distribution: Qualitative contradiction: Poisson equation is linear, but the Boltzmann equation is not! This dilemma is of fundamental importance in electrolyte theory. Its significance becomes more apparent if the exponentials in the Boltzmann distribution equation are expanded in the form: Considering the condition of electrical neutrality, the first term has vanished. And of , only the term linear in is appreciable, giving the result: The result in this approximate form is consistent with the superposition principle since it states that is directly proportional to . The approximation is, however, valid only when the potential energy of the -ion is small compared to its thermal energy ; and though this may well be true for the majority of the -ions in a dilute solution, which are at relatively great distances from the central -ion, it is not valid for those who are close to the -ion. Furthermore, it is well known that even fairly dilute solutions of electrolytes show significant deviations from ideal behaviour, and the reason for this is that the energy of the electrical interactions between ions is, in fact, not small compared to their thermal energy. Nevertheless, we shall use the Debye-Hückle expression for the charge density. Still, we must recognize that in so doing, we are rejecting the Boltzmann distribution and replacing it with the linear relation: There is one case where this approximation is less drastic: when we are dealing with a solution of a single electrolyte of symmetrical valency type. Putting and the equation for the charge density becomes: All the terms in even powers of vanishing. In this particular case, therefore, the approximation involves no error in order as it does in the general case. Therefore, the Debye-Huckel theory is the most successful for 1:1 valence electrolytes, while the effective concentration of asymmetric electrolytes is much smaller. We, therefore, process with the derivation of the theory. Substituting the simplified charge density in the Poisson equation for the case of radical symmetry, we have: Where is defined by: And is a function of the solvent's concentration, ionic charge, temperature, and dielectric constant, having the dimensions of a reciprocal length. After calculation (Omit here), the potential is given by: This is Debye-Hückle's fundamental expression for the time-average potential at a point in the distance from an ion of valency in the absence of external forces. Take the sum of the effective radii of positive and negative ions as the nearest distance , and assume that both positive and negative ions are balls with diameter. This is obviously a rough approximation. is also called \"average ion diameter\". is the electric potential generated by the interaction between cetral ion and ionic atmosphere in the distance of , which means the is the function of , as . This potential can be regarded as the sum of two potentials, that is, the sum of the potentials caused by the central ions when they exist alone and the potentials caused by the ionic atmosphere when they exist alone. The electric potential of the central ion at the distance r is . Let as the electric potential of ionic atmophere at the same point, according to the electric field superposition principle thus This equation is effective for . Because individual ions cannot enter the area of , and the ionic atmosphere is spherical symmetry, the potential in the area is constant, which is equal to the potential at . This is the potential caused by the ionic atmosphere at . This electric potential generate electric energy , which represents the ion electric energy change (downshift) with the absence of ionic atmosphere. But we we apply this equation to every ion in the solution, every ion is calculated for twice, i.e. Let each ion do the central ion once and as a member of ionic atomsphere once. Therefore, the electric energy change caused by ionic atmosphere on an -ion, that is, the electric energy change caused by the mutual attraction of ions on an -ion is The thickness of ionic atmosphere can be rewritten as If an empty ball with a radius of and a charge of , its potential in a medium with a dielectric constant is . By analogy, we know that the radius of the “ball” is , with charges. Thus the thickness of ionic atmosphere is . Predict ionic activity coefficient. In ideal electrolyte However, in actual electrolyte If the activity coefficient is determined by the electrostatic action energy of the -ion The process of calculating It is relatively complex. The basic idea is to investigate the change in the potential of the central ion caused by the high-atom atmosphere, in which the rigid radius of the ion, , needs to be introduced. If an electrolyte unit produces positive ions and negative ions (), and the ionic valence is , and , respectively, then For very dilute solutions, is very small, is proportional to , that is, , which is consistent with Lewis's experimental results!","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Fundamental theories","slug":"Fundamental-theories","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Fundamental-theories/"}]},{"title":"不同浓度标度的换算","slug":"ions-3","date":"2023-02-13T12:58:39.000Z","updated":"2023-03-26T07:39:06.410Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/02/13/ions-3/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/02/13/ions-3/","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Chemical Properties of Solvents","slug":"ions-2","date":"2023-02-11T07:54:02.000Z","updated":"2023-02-12T13:56:51.728Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/02/11/ions-2/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/02/11/ions-2/","excerpt":"","text":"The chemical properties of solvents that are relevant to their dissolution abilities for electrolytes and the ionic dissociation of the latter include their structuredness or self‐association and their donor (electron pair donation, basicity) and acceptor (hydrogen bonding ability, acidity) properties as well as their softness. The mutual solubility with other solvents, in particular water, is also of importance as are the windows for making spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements on solutions of ions in the solvents. Structuredness It is to be hoped that the days are long past when a solvent was considered solely as a medium in which solute species moved about. Much time and effort has been expended in demonstrating the relevance of solute-solvent interactions to the free energy of a solute. This endeavour has more recently been focused on the connection between solvent structure and the energetics of dissolved solutes. The breakdown of this structure is necessary for the creation of a hole to accommodate a solute[1]. The structuredness of solvents is closely related to their self‐association by means of hydrogen bonds or dipole–dipole interactions. solvent structuredness involves the use of two solvent properties-internal pressure and cohesive energy density Cohesive energy density is a measure of the total molecular cohesion per of a solvent, and its magnitude is given by where and are the energy and latent heat of vaporization of the solvent, respectively, and is the molar volume. On vaporization of one mole of solvent, all intermolecular bonds associated with that mole will be broken (assuming negligible interaction in the vapour phase). Thus, , represents the total strength or stiffness of the solvent structure. On the other hand, internal pressure is a measure of the change in internal energy of a solvent as it undergoes a very small isothermal expansion. The magnitude of Pint is , so that at ambient conditions and saturation vapor pressures, the last term, − can be neglected. To understand the physical significance of , one must consider a solvent undergoing a small isothermal expansion. The small expansion does not disrupt all the intermolecular interactions associated with of the solvent. The most important contributions to will come from those interactions varying most rapidly near the equilibrium separation in the solvent. Dispersion, repulsion and dipole-dipole interactions all vary rapidly with intermolecular separation, and so we might expect to reflect mainly these interactions. Thus, the stiffness of solvent is the difference between molar internal energy and internal pressure In the cases of solvents with a hydrogen‐bonded tri-dimensional network, foremost water (both h2O and d2O) but also ethylene glycol, glycerol, and formamide, to name a few, the average number of hydrogen bonds existing in the liquid solvent per solvent molecule is an excellent measure of their structuredness. It depends on external conditions, such as the temperature and pressure, and on the presence of solutes that affect this hydrogen‐bonded structure. The appearance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in a solvent substantially increases the cohesion of that solvent as measured by , but less difference in . In this case, the value of of water is by larger than for other structureed solvents. Solvent properties realted to their ion solvating ability The molecules of solvents have several features that enable them to solvate ions effectively. These include the polarity, measured by the dipole moment, , and the molecular polarizability, , of individual molecules, but have other manifestations in the bulk liquid solvent. The solvents generally include donor atoms that have one or more pairs of free electrons and some are protic and can donate a hydrogen atom toward the formation of hydrogen bonds and can accept a pair of electrons from a donor atom. even aprotic solvents may be protogenic, in that under suitable circumstances, their electronic structure can be rearranged so as to make a hydrogen atom available for hydrogen bonding. I will detail these concepts in the following sections. Polarity The empirical “like-dissolves-like” rule is a vague conclusion but always goes well in solvent solubility. Therefore, polar solvents dissolve polar solutes and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes. we can observe that iodine (a nonpolar species) dissolves readily in 1,1,1-trichloroethane (a nonpolar solvent), but does not dissolve in water (a polar solvent). Immiscibility of liquids with different polarities can also be demonstrated by the failure of the trichloroethane and water to mix. However, this definition is rather arbitrary and has not been widely used in subsequent literature. Even with a definition at hand, it is difficult to know quantitatively how “like” two liquids need to be in order to be miscible. Recent research used field-theoretic variational methods and formulated a first-principles molecular-based theory for dipole-dipole interactions in liquid mixtures[2]. This paper quantify the theory of \"like-dissolve-like\", and could be a feasible method for solvent selection. But it is too complicated to easily handle (😅). Electron pair donicity and ability to accept a hydrogen bond The ability of solvent molecules to donate a free electron pair from their donor atoms (O, N, S) to coordinate with acceptor atoms of solutes is a measure of the solvent donicity. It can also be construed as its basicity in the Lewis and the Brönsted senses, because it also describes the ability of the solvent molecules to accept a proton from a Brönsted acid to be protonated or to form a hydrogen bond. This property is expressed in terms of the Gutmann donor number DN, which is the negative of the standard molar enthalpy of reaction of the solvent with the Lewis acid antimony pentachloride, both in dilute solution in the inert solvent 1,2-dichloroethane (in units). It is assumed that this quantity, pertaining to solvent molecules in dilute solution, represents also the property of the bulk solvent. It is also to be noted that for solvents associated by hydrogen bond networks (water and alkanols), their molecules in dilute solution in inert solvents have considerably lower values than those for the bulk solvents, in which the cooperative effect of the hydrogen bonding enhances the donicity. Hydrogen bond donicity and electron pair acceptance The electron pair acceptance propensity of the molecules of a solvent are closely related to its ability to provide protons for hydrogen bonding, and hence is confined to protic or at least protogenic solvents among those on our list. The latter solvents include chloro-form and solvent having a methyl group adjacent to a , , or group. The Gutmann–Mayer acceptor number scale AN uses the NMR chemical shift δ of the atom of riethylphosphine oxide as the electron‐pair donor probe in dilute solution in the solvent to be studied relative to the shift in n‐hexane. Softness A further property of solvents that is relevant to their solvation of ions is their softness. The general rule that soft solvents preferably solvate soft ions and hard solvents do so for hard ions is valid (\"like-dissolves-like\"). Among the solvents on our list, the majority is hard (they have oxygen donor atoms) but a few are soft—pyridine, acetonitrile, tetrahydrothiophene, and these indeed solvate soft cations more strongly than expected from other properties that they have. On the other hand, the solvation of soft anions by the soft solvents is not particularly enhanced. The softness of solvents is best expressed by the difference of , the standard molar Gibbs energy of transfer from water as the source solvent to the target solvent under study, of silver ions on the one hand and the mean of the values for sodium and potassium on the other: Other measures of solvent softness have also been established by using the raman spectrum of the (soft) mercury bromide or the infrared spectrum of iodine cyanide. Solvent as acids and bases The electron pair donicity and acceptance ability of solvent molecules are reflected in their bulk properties. They are, of course, related to their reactions as acids and bases pertaining specifically to the deprotonation or protonation in the gas phase, on the one hand, and these reactions in dilute solutions in a reference solvent (water) on the other, as well as their autoprotolysis as pure liquids. The deprotonation of gaseous molecules of protic or protogenic solvents is measured by the standard molar Gibbs energy, , of the reaction where stands for a protic solvent molecule. The protonation of gaseous solvent molecules is measured by the standard molar enthalpy, called proton affinity, PA, of the reaction , where stands for a solvent molecule. Miscibility with and solubility in water Aqueous solutions of electrolytes that dissociate into ions have been and are studied so extensively that it is natural to enquire about the solutions of electrolytes in binary mixtures of water and cosolvents. Related to the mutual solubility of solvents with water is their lipophilicity or hydrophobicity that can be described by (the logarithm of) their partition coefficient between n‐octanol and water, . The more hydrophobic a substance is, the larger the value of for its partition. A linear expression connects the solubility of the solvent in water with this partition coefficient: It is noted that the majority of solvents generally used for the dissolution of electrolytes are completely miscible with water and are very hydrophilic, having negative values of .","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fundamental theories","slug":"fundamental-theories","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/fundamental-theories/"},{"name":"Marcus","slug":"Marcus","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Marcus/"},{"name":"solvent","slug":"solvent","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/solvent/"}]},{"title":"Ions and Their Properties-Intro","slug":"Ions-1","date":"2023-02-09T12:48:14.000Z","updated":"2023-02-12T13:55:22.421Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/02/09/Ions-1/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/02/09/Ions-1/","excerpt":"","text":"Ions as Isolated Particles-Intro Isolated or Bare ions: Ions in an ideal gaseous state are devoid of interactions with other particles or their surroundings are commonly monatomic or consist of relatively few atoms.

Ionization potential: An isolated ion is formed from an atom, a radical, or a molecule by either losing one or more electrons in an ionization process to form a cation or gaining an electron in an electron capture process to form an anion. The ionization process may proceed in several successive stages and requires the investment of energy.

The whole process only does electric work. Because point A is still in a vacuum, The short-range force between the charged particle (ion, electron, etc.) and conductor has not yet occurred. The outer potential is measurable. Requirements for the unit charge \"The unit charge being transported only tests (or “probes”) the charge on the metal. The unit test charge must not itself interact with the metal; it should only sense the charge on the metal. It must be a spectator, not an actor.\" \"Modern Electrochemistry 2A\" Surface Potential Definition: The electric work done by transferring the unit negative charge from point away from the conductor phase M, across the interface dipole layer, to point B in the M phase is called the surface potential of the conductor M. The whole process only does electric work. Apparently, in this transferring process, there is not only electric work but chemical effect work (chemical potential). However, separating electrical or chemical effect work from the transferring process is impossible. Besides, closely relates to the properties of conductor material and its surface structure. Therefore, is unmeasurable. Figure 2. Causes of metal surface potential In the bulk phase, the density of free electrons is equal everywhere. The electron density in the surface area decreases with the distance from the surface. In the metal surface, the electrons are imbalanced. They tend to come out of the metal surface and enter the vacuum to reduce the kinetic energy. The distance between these electrons and the positive ion nucleus increases, and the potential energy increases. The two factors work together to reach an equilibrium. Spill Over: When the temperature rises, some electrons are excited, and the quantum tunneling effect occurs, so that they can be distributed within away from the metal surface Chemical Potential Definition: The short-rang interaction work done by reversibly transferring the unit molar species from point away from the conductor phase M, across the interfacial dipole layer, to point B in the M phase is called the chemical potential of the conductor M. Real Potential Transferring unit molar species with charge number from point to the inner point B of the conductor phase M needs to overcome both the surface potential and the chemical potential of the point in the phase M. Inner Potential/ Galvani Potential Figure 3. Illustration of inner potential Definition: In a vacuum, the electric work is done by transferring the unit negative charge from infinite to a point B in the phase M is called the inner potential. As illustrated in Figure 3, the inner potential is the sum of surface potential and outer potential. The electrostatic term associated with crossing the layer of interfacial-orientated dipoles, and another electrostatic term associated with the charge on the phase. Electrochemical Potential Definition: The total work done by reversibly transferring the unit molar species with charge number from infinity to a point in the phase M is equal to the electrochemical potential of species in the phase M. The whole process contains long-range work and short-range work, which is The deduced equation decomposes the electrochemical potential to the chemical work and electric work . The work function of metal Definition: The minimal work done by moving an electron from an uncharged conductor M in a vacuum to the outer surface in point A. The process must overcome the chemical interaction between electron and inner particles and transport through the interfacial dipole layer. It is the same as taking an electron from the Fermi energy level of metal to the surface of the metal. According to the definition of the work function, it is surprising to know that it is precisely opposite to the real potential. What is electrode potential? Absolute electrode potential Firstly, we need to consider the electrode reaction's equilibrium condition. Actually, in the interface of electrode and electrolyte in an equilibrium state, the competitiveness of oxidation reaction and reduction reaction is equal (shown in Figure 4) Figure 4. The equilibrium condition of the electrode reaction The electron exchange (redox reaction) happens between the electrode and redox species. When it reaches the equilibrium state, the algebraic sum of the electrochemical potential of reactant(s) and product(s) (including electrons) is equal to zero. Further decomposing the electrochemical potential will lead to the following equation. Since metal is in brimming with electrons, here we suppose the activity of electrons in metal electrode M is equal to 1 (); Besides, in a redox reaction , there always has and \"\" indicates the negative charge of electrons. Therefore, Compared with the Nernst equation of redox electrode, we could assume an expression of absolute electrode potential But is this assumption correct? We can rationalize this definition of absolute electrode potential by designing a specific cell, as depicted in Figure 5. The and are the same kind of meta () for the electrode to be measured (work electrode) and the current collector of the reference electrode (Ref). Figure 5. The diagram of the designed cell The open circuit voltage (OCV) directly relates to the electrochemical potential difference of both sides. The tested OCV from an external circuit equals the sum of all the interfacial potential differences inside the cell. To get a stable result of OCV, the electrons between M' and Ref are in electrochemical equilibrium. Combining the above equations, we get Recalling the proposed definition of absolute electrode potential, such a designed cell's OCV (E) equals the absolute electrode potential difference between the work electrode and reference electrode. To this point, the definition of absolute electrode potential successfully applies to the specific cell with the same material for the working electrode and the current collector of the reference electrode. Further details of the logical explanation can be seen in \"电极过程动力学导论\" by 查全性. Above all, we can accurately express the definition of absolute electrode potential in an electrode/electrolyte interface. How to understand the absolute electrode potential? From the viewpoint of work Now, we look at the left side of the absolute electrode potential equation. It is not clear about the relation with work from this expression, but we can further deduce this equation. Now, if we product the charges of electrons () in the both left and right side of the equation, we can conclude that the absolute electrode potential (product Fraday constant ) is equal to the whole worke done by transferring electrons from the Fermi levels of metal electrode to a vacuum and then move to the inner point of electrolyte (Figure 6). Illustration of absolute electrode potential from work viewpoint Meanwhile, we can conclude from the above equation that the more work needed, the species are harder to accept electrons from metal electrode, which cooresponding to the higher equilibrium electrode potential. From the view point of Gibbs free energy When a redox reaction reachs its equilibrium, the abolute electrode potential has an alternative expression From this equation, we could define the standerd absolute electrode potential The standerd absolute electrode potential cooresponds to the change of standerd Gibbs free energy in reaction: . In thermodynamics, the more negative the is, the reaction is more likely to forward occur, accordingly, is harder to occur. In the case of total reaction including both sides of electrode reaction, where is equal to the difference in absolute electrode potential between the positive electrode and the negative electrode (discussed above), Then considering each absolute electrode potential, So, the case is that the change of Gibbs free energy of the total cell reaction is the sum of the changes of Gibbs free energy of each electrode reaction. Note to say that the electrons terms are not included. From the viewpoint of electric work Figure 7. Relationships among electronic states at an interface between a metal electrode and a solution containing species O and R at equal concentrations. The metal electrode can be considered as the reservoir of electrons or \"electrons ocean\". When the value of equilibrium electrode potential is more negative, the ocean level is higher, which greater the potential of electrons to do external work. There are two more concepts need to address. Metal's Fermi level: the energy level where electron occupation probability in metal equals to when . Liquid's Fermi level: the energy level where redox pair occupation probability in solution equals to . A stable interfacial potential difference is constructed when the electrode reaction reaches equilibrium. At this time, both the metal and the solution have a specific internal potential, and the electrons on the Fermi level of the metal have specific electrostatic potential energy and electrochemical potential. The electrons on the Fermi energy level of the metal and the Fermi energy level of the Redox pair in the solution at the time of reaction equilibrium are equal. Under the applied potential, The Nernst electrode process corresponds to the relation that the ability of the electrode potential represent the metal to give electrons to the redox pair in the solution. Figure 8. The Nernst electrode process To summarize all the above, the electrode potential strongly depends on the electrode reaction, and we can explain this potential through different methods or viewpoints. The core concept is the description of electron transfer. The above theory may not fully explain the mysterious electrode potential, but it is an excellent introduction to a broader world of electrochemistry.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fundamental theories","slug":"fundamental-theories","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/fundamental-theories/"}]},{"title":"Thermodynamics of Electrochemistry","slug":"thermodynamics-basic","date":"2023-01-28T16:58:23.000Z","updated":"2023-02-12T14:03:23.873Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/01/29/thermodynamics-basic/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/01/29/thermodynamics-basic/","excerpt":"","text":"Faraday's Law During electrolysis, the amount of substance precipitated on the electrode is proportional to the excess charge.
