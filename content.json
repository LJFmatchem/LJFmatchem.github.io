The ionization process may proceed in several successive stages and requires the investment of energy.

The whole process only does electric work. Because point A is still in a vacuum, The short-range force between the charged particle (ion, electron, etc.) and conductor has not yet occurred. The outer potential is measurable. Requirements for the unit charge \"The unit charge being transported only tests (or “probes”) the charge on the metal. The unit test charge must not itself interact with the metal; it should only sense the charge on the metal. It must be a spectator, not an actor.\" \"Modern Electrochemistry 2A\" Surface Potential Definition: The electric work done by transferring the unit negative charge from point away from the conductor phase , across the interface dipole layer, to point C in the phase is called the surface potential of the conductor . The whole process only does electric work. Apparently, in this transferring process, there is not only electric work but chemical effect work (chemical potential). However, separating electrical or chemical effect work from the transferring process is impossible. Besides, closely relates to the properties of conductor material and its surface structure. Therefore, is unmeasurable. Figure 2. Causes of metal surface potential In the bulk phase, the density of free electrons is equal everywhere. The electron density in the surface area decreases with the distance from the surface. In the metal surface, the electrons are imbalanced. They tend to come out of the metal surface and enter the vacuum to reduce the kinetic energy. The distance between these electrons and the positive ion nucleus increases, and the potential energy increases. The two factors work together to reach an equilibrium. Spill Over: When the temperature rises, some electrons are excited, and the quantum tunneling effect occurs, so that they can be distributed within away from the metal surface Chemical Potential Definition: The short-rang interaction work done by reversibly transferring the unit molar species from point away from the conductor phase , across the interfacial dipole layer, to point C in the phase is called the chemical potential of the conductor . Real Potential Transferring unit molar species with charge number from point away from the conductor phase needs to overcome both the surface potential and the chemical potential of the point in the phase . Inner Potential/ Galvani Potential Figure 3. Illustration of inner potential Definition: In a vacuum, the electric work is done by transferring the unit negative charge from infinite to a point in the phase is called the inner potential. As illustrated in Figure 3, the inner potential is the sum of surface potential and outer potential. The electrostatic term associated with crossing the layer of interfacial-orientated dipoles, and another electrostatic term associated with the charge on the phase. Electrochemical Potential Definition: The total work done by reversibly transferring the unit molar species with charge number from infinity to a point in the phase is equal to the electrochemical potential of species in the phase . The whole process contains long-range work and short-range work, which is The deduced equation decomposes the electrochemical potential to the chemical work and electric work . The work function of metal Definition: The minimal work done by moving an electron from an uncharged conductor in a vacuum to the outer surface in point A. The process must overcome the chemical interaction between electron and inner particles and transport through the interfacial dipole layer. It is the same as taking an electron from the Fermi energy level of metal to the surface of the metal. According to the definition of the work function, it is surprising to know that it is precisely opposite to the real potential. What is electrode potential? Absolute electrode potential Firstly, we need to consider the electrode reaction's equilibrium condition. Actually, in the interface of electrode and electrolyte in an equilibrium state, the competitiveness of oxidation reaction and reduction reaction is equal (shown in Figure 4) Figure 4. The equilibrium condition of the electrode reaction The electron exchange (redox reaction) happens between the electrode and redox species. When it reaches the equilibrium state, the algebraic sum of the electrochemical potential of reactant(s) and product(s) (including electrons) is equal to zero. Further decomposing the electrochemical potential will lead to the following equation. Since metal is in brimming with electrons, here we suppose the activity of electrons in metal electrode M is equal to 1 (); Besides, in a redox reaction , there always has and \"\" indicates the negative charge of electrons. Therefore, Compared with the Nernst equation of redox electrode, we could assume an expression of absolute electrode potential But is this assumption correct? We can rationalize this definition of absolute electrode potential by designing a specific cell, as depicted in Figure 5. The and are the same kind of meta () for the electrode to be measured (work electrode) and the current collector of the reference electrode (Ref). Figure 5. The diagram of the designed cell The open circuit voltage (OCV) directly relates to the electrochemical potential difference of both sides. The tested OCV from an external circuit equals the sum of all the interfacial potential differences inside the cell. To get a stable result of OCV, the electrons between M' and Ref are in electrochemical equilibrium. Combining the above equations, we get Recalling the proposed definition of absolute electrode potential, such a designed cell's OCV (E) equals the absolute electrode potential difference between the work electrode and reference electrode. To this point, the definition of absolute electrode potential successfully applies to the specific cell with the same material for the working electrode and the current collector of the reference electrode. Further details of the logical explanation can be seen in \"电极过程动力学导论\" by 查全性. Above all, we can accurately express the definition of absolute electrode potential in an electrode/electrolyte interface. How to understand the absolute electrode potential? From the viewpoint of work Now, we look at the left side of the absolute electrode potential equation. It is not clear about the relation with work from this expression, but we can further deduce this equation. Now, if we product the charges of electrons () in the both left and right side of the equation, we can conclude that the absolute electrode potential (product Fraday constant ) is equal to the whole worke done by transferring electrons from the Fermi levels of metal electrode to a vacuum and then move to the inner point of electrolyte (Figure 6). Illustration of absolute electrode potential from work viewpoint Meanwhile, we can conclude from the above equation that the more work needed, the species are harder to accept electrons from metal electrode, which cooresponding to the higher equilibrium electrode potential. From the view point of Gibbs free energy When a redox reaction reachs its equilibrium, the abolute electrode potential has an alternative expression From this equation, we could define the standerd absolute electrode potential The standerd absolute electrode potential cooresponds to the change of standerd Gibbs free energy in reaction: . In thermodynamics, the more negative the is, the reaction is more likely to forward occur, accordingly, is harder to occur. In the case of total reaction including both sides of electrode reaction, where is equal to the difference in absolute electrode potential between the positive electrode and the negative electrode (discussed above), Then considering each absolute electrode potential, So, the case is that the change of Gibbs free energy of the total cell reaction is the sum of the changes of Gibbs free energy of each electrode reaction. Note to say that the electrons terms are not included. From the viewpoint of electric work Figure 7. Relationships among electronic states at an interface between a metal electrode and a solution containing species O and R at equal concentrations. The metal electrode can be considered as the reservoir of electrons or \"electrons ocean\". When the value of equilibrium electrode potential is more negative, the ocean level is higher, which greater the potential of electrons to do external work. There are two more concepts need to address. Metal's Fermi level: the energy level where electron occupation probability in metal equals to when . Liquid's Fermi level: the energy level where redox pair occupation probability in solution equals to . A stable interfacial potential difference is constructed when the electrode reaction reaches equilibrium. At this time, both the metal and the solution have a specific internal potential, and the electrons on the Fermi level of the metal have specific electrostatic potential energy and electrochemical potential. The electrons on the Fermi energy level of the metal and the Fermi energy level of the Redox pair in the solution at the time of reaction equilibrium are equal. Under the applied potential, The Nernst electrode process corresponds to the relation that the ability of the electrode potential represent the metal to give electrons to the redox pair in the solution. Figure 8. The Nernst electrode process To summarize all the above, the electrode potential strongly depends on the electrode reaction, and we can explain this potential through different methods or viewpoints. The core concept is the description of electron transfer. The above theory may not fully explain the mysterious electrode potential, but it is an excellent introduction to a broader world of electrochemistry.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fundamental theories","slug":"fundamental-theories","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/fundamental-theories/"}]},{"title":"Thermodynamics of Electrochemistry","slug":"thermodynamics-basic","date":"2023-01-28T16:58:23.000Z","updated":"2023-01-31T07:05:33.726Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/01/29/thermodynamics-basic/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/01/29/thermodynamics-basic/","excerpt":"Thermodynamics of reversible batteries Basics of thermodynamics of electrochemistry Faraday's Law During electrolysis, the amount of substance precipitated on the electrode is proportional to the excess charge.","text":"Thermodynamics of reversible batteries Basics of thermodynamics of electrochemistry Faraday's Law During electrolysis, the amount of substance precipitated on the electrode is proportional to the excess charge. Where the faraday constant is The represent the faraday law applied in a more sepecific condition of electrochemial process. The first term is sum of the excess charge of parallel electrochemical reactions. The second term relate to the charging current. Zeroth law of thermodynamics Several phases/systems in contact with each other are in thermal equilibrium condition: all strength properties (temperature, pressure, chemical potential, electrochemical potential) of each phase/system are equal State functions A system is defined by its own state functions and has nothing to do with its history and environment Entropy Definition of statistical thermodynamics where is the number of all microstates in a system, assuming that the probability of each microstate is equal. Another definition relate to termal energy When a system worked externally near reversibility, the exchanged heat with environment is minimal, and cooresponding to the change of entropy. Internal Energy Internal energy of single-phase multi-component system The expression of the internal energy change of the system, including the input heat energy to the system when changing the entropy, the energy change caused by doing the volume work, and the Gibbs free energy (Non-volume work in reverible system) change caused by doing the chemical work when adding some substances to the system. Internal energy of dual-phase multi-component system The change of GIbbs free energy is described as adding substrance into enery phase and summing the total change chemical potential changes of the system . This term can be the result of (electro)chemical reaction for a closed system; Besides, the surface energy (phase interphase free energy) is reprensent as . Surfance energy is not independent of other state functions, the term is not account. Gibbs free energy Gibbs free energy of single-phase multi-component system Generally, the research of electrochemistry is conduct under a isothermo and isopressure conditon. The change of Gibbs free energy can be reduced as In the above case, the chemical reaction inside the system is the sole contribution of the Gibbs free energy change. Similarly, the Gibbs free energy of dual-phase multi-component system State functions description of electrode/electrolyte interface Gibbs free energy descriptor for electrode/electrolyte is better than internal energy. SInce most electrochemical processes happened on the interface is in a condition, and Gibbs free energy is directly related to the non-volume work including electrical work and chemical potential. Gibbs free energy of single-phase charged system Where : inner potential/Galvani potential of the phase; : the excess charge represents the variations in charge associated with the addition of species . In the process of adding the charged substance to the phase, chemical work and electrical work need to be done at the same time. Chemical work and electrical work are occurring at the same time, which is indistinguishable. Thus, the electrochemical potential is defined (note: ). Behind the definition of electrochemical potential, there is a basic assumptions that the phase within the charged particle is large enough, and adding charged particles does not change the internal potential of the modified phase. i.e. is indenpendent of . \"The electrochemical potential is a measure of the work needed to move one mole of ions from a vacuum into a phase, at constant pressure and temperature. Nevertheless, absolutely speaking, it is impossible to add ions to a phase without changing its charge and therefore its outer potential. Consequently, the notion of electrochemical potential defined by this is a virtual one.\" \"ANALYTICAL and PHYSICAL ELECTROCHEMISTRY\" by HubertH .Girault Gibbs free energy of electrochemical system The electrochemical system is usually an open system containing multiphase, multi-component and charged particles, which can exchange materials and energy with the environment. The process in the electrochemical reaction system is usually carried out under constant surface area and isothermal and isopressure of each interface. When equilibrium is achieved, the inner potential of each phase remains unchanged.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fundamental theories","slug":"fundamental-theories","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/fundamental-theories/"}]}],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"fundamental theories","slug":"fundamental-theories","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/fundamental-theories/"},{"name":"Marcus","slug":"Marcus","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Marcus/"}]}
